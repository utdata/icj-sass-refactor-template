# Lesson to refactor CSS to SCSS

## Set up the project

- Download the repo (don't clone) into your `/icj` folder.
- Unzip the file and rename the resulting folder `yourname-sass`.
- Open the folder in VS Code
- Go to github and create a new repo also called `yourname-sass`. DO NOT include the README.
- The resulting directions in Github should be performed in your VS Code terminal.
- Push to Github to make sure they are connected. When you refresh your github repo, you should see the files.

## npm setup

- run `npm install` in your terminal to set up the development environment.

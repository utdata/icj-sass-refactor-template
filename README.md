# Lesson to refactor CSS to SCSS

A template to use in learning Sass. See the [ICJ class](https://github.com/utdata/icj-class#sass) for more info.

## Project setup with degit

An easy way to use download and use a template from a repo is [degit](), which ICJ students should have installed when they set up Node.

- Create your local project folder.
- From inside the folder, run `degit utdata/icj-sass-template`.
- Run `npm install` to install dependences.
- Run `gulp dev` to run Sass and start the development server.

## Project setup through downloading

If you don't have degit, you can still use this repo:

- Download the repo (don't clone).
- Unzip the file and rename the resulting folder `yourname-sass` and the move it into your `/icj` folder.
- Open the folder in VS Code (either through Terminal or **Open Folder** in VS Code).
- Go to github and create a new repo also called `yourname-sass`. DO NOT include the README.
- The resulting directions in Github should be performed in your VS Code terminal, with one exception:
  - Use `git add .` to add all the files instead of just the README.
- Push to Github to make sure they are connected. When you refresh your github repo, you should see all the files.
- run `npm install` in your terminal to set up the development environment.
- run `gulp` to start your development server.
